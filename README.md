# What to Watch

What to watch is a web app which allows you to get an anime recommendation based on your myAnimeList (MAL) plan-to-watch (PTW) list.

The web app can be accessed at https://whattowatchimp.herokuapp.com/

# Why does this exist?

A problem that I've found is that I keep on adding shows into my PTW list and forget about them. As a result, when I come back to my PTW list later, I'm overwhelmed by what I put into the list.
When I tried to use the MAL anime list sorting features I discovered that they do not lend themselves well to finding a good anime you haven't watched yet.
On top of this, I've found that the suggestions given by MAL themselves doesn't include anime already in your PTW.

This app is designed to solve this problem I had and I hope it can help others who have had the same issue!
